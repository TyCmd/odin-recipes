    <bold>Ingredients for the Teriyaki Sauce</bold>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon low-sodium steak seasoning (such as Montreal Steak Seasoning®)</li>
    </ul>

    <bold>Ingredients for the bowls</bold>

    <ul>
        <li>4 cups hot cooked white rice</li>
        <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and diced</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons sour cream (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 green onions, chopped (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <bold>Instructions</bold>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the marinade, place lime juice, jalapeño, garlic, balsamic vinegar, ginger, sugar, cumin, chili
            powder, salt, cayenne pepper, white pepper, cilantro, and extra-virgin olive oil in a food processor or
            blender. Pulse several times to blend, then purée about 1 minute.; measure out 1/2 cup and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Place the remaining marinade in a 1-gallon plastic resealable bag. Add steak and squeeze out as
            much air as possible. Reseal the bag and refrigerate at least 1 hour, or up to 8 hours. </li>
        <li>To make the vegetable relish, combine corn, black beans, and red bell pepper in a large bowl.
             Toss with reserved 1/2 cup marinade until well mixed; refrigerate until ready to serve. </li>
        <li>Remove marinated steak from the refrigerator about 5 minutes before cooking.</li>
        <li>Place butter and olive oil in a cast-iron skillet over medium high heat. Blot both
            sides of steak with a paper towel; sprinkle both sides with Montreal seasoning. Add seasoned steak
            to the skillet when butter is foamy. Cook, undisturbed, until browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Discard marinade. </li>
        <li>Turn steak; cook until browned and desired internal temperature is achieved, 3 to 4 minutes. If the steak is
            browning too quickly, remove the skillet from heat and allow residual heat to continue cooking. An
            instant-read thermometer inserted near the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium-rare, 140
            degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium, and about 150 degrees F (65 degrees C) for medium-well done. </li>
        <li>Remove steak to rest on a cutting board, tented with foil, about 10 minutes. Slice thinly across the grain of the steak. </li>
        <li>While steak is resting, prepare the bowls. Fill each bowl with 1 cup of rice. Stir chopped avocado into vegetable relish, and top rice with
            about 1 cup relish and 1/4 of the steak slices. Garnish each bowl with 1 tablespoon sour cream and chopped
            green onions.</li>
    </ol>
